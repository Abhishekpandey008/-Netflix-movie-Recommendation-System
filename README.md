We performed the data pre-processing techniques on sample data, After data pre-processing we did   exploratory data analysis on pre-processed data, after visualization, we computed a similarity matrix for USER-USER  and Movie-Movie to compute similar user.  we featurised the sample data for the regression model using self-defined features After that we featurised data using the various technique from the SURPRISE library and then we applied the XGboost algorithm. After each step, we use every featurization technique as a feature in the Regression model, and then we applied the Xgboost algorithm on top of it.
we use matrix factorization techniques such as SVD and SVD++ and then we applied the Xgboost algorithm to use them as a feature in the regression model as well used RMSE and MAPE to compare each model
